# Week 1 report

## This week

During this week I have been pondering about the topic - I thought of one, which is close to my work discussed it briefly it teacher and decided to change. 
I had few other work related topics in mind, but decided not to spend time arguing my case, even if those would have been accepted, and decided to go with maze creation.

The course started on Wednesday evenening and I managed to decide my topic Friday noon, so on that front nothing much has happened.

Now that I have topic settled I have spent time reading on the topic and have created project template (gradle + github) for me to continue my work.

## Next steps

Next I will continue to get familiar with the topic - decide few algorithms - and work on the concept of UI. Text or graphic, probably JavaFX, and how the program
architecture should look like. Just to limit time spent on refactoring.

## Time spent

This week I have used roughly three (3) hours working on the project: 1,5 topic selection and background, and 1,5 hours on writing weekly report and project definition
