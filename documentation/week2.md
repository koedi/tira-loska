# Week 2 report

## This week

This week I started to work on the implementation. First rough JavaFX UI and then working on the first algoritm internals.

Main target was to have frame to continue working on.

## Next steps

Continue on the implementation. Try to get first algorithm done.

## Time spent

Unfortunately work intervened with free time too much this week and not much happened. Time spent until Friday evening <5 hours.
