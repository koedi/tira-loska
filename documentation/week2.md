# Week 2 report

## This week

This week I started to work on the implementation. First step was to get Gradle + JavaFX + other dependencies in place. 
Main target was to have frame to continue working on. As this was done, I started to work on the architecture for Maze and algorithms.
Currently Maze and Generators are different object, but for expandability and better architecture interface or inheritance would be better. I need to think about this.

Testing is not started as this week I had little time to work on this project.

Problems:

how to represent the maze
how to represent the cell connections (not final yet)

## Next steps

Continue on the implementation. First algorithm done, visualisation in JavaFX, (opt.) parametrisation and testing (junit + codecov + checkstyle)..

## Time spent

Unfortunately work intervened with free time too much this week and not much happened. Time spent until Friday evening 4 hours.
