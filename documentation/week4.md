# Week 4 report

## This week

Week 4 started finalising BT and DFS cleanup and general improvements. There still might be need for small refactoring, but we'll see. Continued adding JUnit tests for both BT and DFS. Now the coverage should be ok -- some of the tests could be a bit more thorough and test more cornercases etc.

Week 4 continued with GUI creation. Stitching parts piece by piece and finally something reasonable was available. GUI needed some modifications here and there to have variable visibility etc. in place. I am not 100 % happy with current solution, but my lack of JavaFX did this. If there is time then I will refine this part a bit. 

The Maze Display part still needs a bit work, at least scrolling should be implemented. Scaling probably not.

## Next steps

Tests for the general UI methods. The GUI I will leave untested.

Documentation (implementation and testing) to be finalised.
