# Week 3 report

## This week

Week started (on Saturday) with implementing testing framework using GitHub Actions. Test framework implementation continued on JUnit and Codecov. Both are now working and run as a part of GitHub Actions CI. One badge for successfully completing all tests (JUnit, Checkstyle) and one badge to display Codecov status. Both are visible on "main page".
### Test actions implemented:
- [x] Checkstyle
- [x] JUnit
- [x] Codecov
