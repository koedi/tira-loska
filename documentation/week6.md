# Week 6 report

## This week

Doing changes based on peer review #1. As the unlimited recursion will end up to stack overflow, I limited the max values to 100/100. The input fields are now limited to 1-100 and this is checked in real time. Currently it is possible to leave field(s) empt and push maze creation button. This is also checked and in case of empty field the values are defaulted to 10/10.

Documentation was improved -- definition and user guide are still unfinished.

Peer review #2 was done and I found few pointers how to improve my gradle setup.

TODO: display maze integrity result in the UI -- single box with NOK/OK should be fine

## Next steps

Check if peer review #2 creates any changes. Documentation finalisation and program wrap-up.
